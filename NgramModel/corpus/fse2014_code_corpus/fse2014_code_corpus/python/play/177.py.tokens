This is the protocol 0 version of protocol 1's OBJ opcode. INST is followed by two newline-terminated strings, giving a module and class name, just as for the GLOBAL opcode (and see GLOBAL for more details about that). self.find_class(module, name) is used to get a class object. In addition, all the objects on the stack following the topmost markobject are gathered into a tuple and popped (along with the topmost markobject), just as for the TUPLE opcode. Now it gets complicated. If all of these are true: + The argtuple is empty (markobject was at the top of the stack at the start). + It's an old-style class object (the type of the class object is ClassType). + The class object does not have a __getinitargs__ attribute. then we want to create an old-style class instance without invoking its __init__() method (pickle has waffled on this over the years; not calling __init__() is current wisdom). In this case, an instance of an old-style dummy class is created, and then we try to rebind its __class__ attribute to the desired class object. If this succeeds, the new instance object is pushed on the stack, and we're done. In restricted execution mode it can fail (assignment to __class__ is disallowed), and I'm not really sure what happens then -- it looks like the code ends up calling the class object's __init__ anyway, via falling into the next case. Else (the argtuple is not empty, it's not an old-style class object, or the class object does have a __getinitargs__ attribute), the code first insists that the class object have a __safe_for_unpickling__ attribute. Unlike as for the __safe_for_unpickling__ check in REDUCE, it doesn't matter whether this attribute has a true or false value, it only matters whether it exists (XXX this is a bug; cPickle requires the attribute to be true). If __safe_for_unpickling__ doesn't exist, UnpicklingError is raised. Else (the class object does have a __safe_for_unpickling__ attr), the class object obtained from INST's arguments is applied to the argtuple obtained from the stack, and the resulting instance object is pushed on the stack.

Instead the class object is taken off the stack, immediately above the topmost markobject: Stack before: ... markobject classobject stackslice Stack after: ... new_instance_object As for INST, the remainder of the stack above the markobject is gathered into an argument tuple, and then the logic seems identical, except that no __safe_for_unpickling__ check is done (XXX this is a bug; cPickle does test __safe_for_unpickling__).
