Development Schedule

[Restart] [21, May, 2018] Preparation for Project NGramModel.
[Keep Moving 1] [22, May, 2018] Run the project with no error. Define and fix some classes.
[Keep Moving 2] [22, May, 2018] Support the type parameter. Implement the function trainBasicNGramModel in the class BasicNGram, and it needs to be tested critically.
[Keep Moving 3] [23, May, 2018] Improve the code in class Tokensequence(splitSequence etc.)
[Keep Moving 4] [23, May, 2018] Simple test on the class BasicNGram, run with no errors.
[Keep Moving 5] [24, May, 2018] Redefine hashCode() in class Tokensequence and optimize the structure of the project.
[Keep Moving 6] [24, May, 2018] Find the corpus, and commit.
[Keep Moving 7] [25, May, 2018] Try a new implementation of hashCode() in class Tokensequence.
[Keep Moving 8] [25, May, 2018] Define interface AppRunNGram and CacheNGram which is the subclass of BasicNGram.
[Keep Moving 9] [28, May, 2018] Define class Tokenstream to pack input token. Function importStreamFromFile in Tokenstream has not been well defined.
[Keep Moving 10] [28, May, 2018] Succussful run and correct output. Structure of code need to be polished. Class and functions relevant to Type var K need to be redesigned.
[Keep Moving 11] [29, May, 2018] Merge dataset2 into dataset1.
[Keep Moving 12] [29, May, 2018] Add configuration file, and begin to implement multiple training files importer.
[Keep Moving 13] [30, May, 2018] Accomplish the implemtation of multiple training files importer.
[Keep Moving 14] [30, May, 2018] Some architecture optimization.
[Keep Moving 15] [31, May, 2018] Add the Tokentransformer class and it need to be implemented totally. This can optimize the structure of code.
[Keep Moving 16] [31, May, 2018] Define method convertCharStreamToTokenStream in Tokenstream.
[Keep Moving 17] [1, June, 2018] Remove the Charstream.java and BasicNCharGram.java.Add some annotations.
[Keep Moving 18] [1, June, 2018] Fix the error of N in BasicNGram Model. Add some annotations.
[Keep Moving 19] [2, June, 2018] Fix the bug which cause output error in the inference.
[Keep Moving 20] [4, June, 2018] Add time record and optimize the hashcode of several classes relevant to token.
[Keep Moving 21] [5, June, 2018] Add refining module into the project. Implement laplacesmoothing.
[Keep Moving 22] [5, June, 2018] Add other smoothing methods in the refineunit package. Create the module of evaluation.
[Keep Moving 23] [6, June, 2018] Fix a bug in Tokensequence.java
[Keep Moving 24] [6, June, 2018] Redesign NgramRunEngine and BasicNGram
[Keep Moving 25] [7, June, 2018] Redesign the CorpusImporter module. Add some annotations.
[Keep Moving 26] [11, June, 2018] Delete the class TokenTramsformer
[Keep Moving 27] [12, June, 2018] Add seqProbModel in BasicNGram class. Bug: output 0.0
[Keep Moving 28] [14, June,2018] Refine seqProModel and test successfully. Need to implement the probabilityCalculation in NLngramRunEngine using smoothing
[Keep Moving 29] [14, June, 2018] List the subtasks in devmemo.txt
[Keep Moving 30] [21, June, 2018] Download corpus PENN TREEBANK SAMPLE.
[Keep Moving 31] [23, June, 2018] Change AbsolutePath to RelativePath
[Keep Moving 32] [1, July, 2018] Implementation of BasicNGram and its evaluation DONE. Need debug.
[Keep Moving 33] [2, July, 2018] Redegin kernel model seqCntModel in BasicNGram.
[Keep Moving 34] [4, July, 2018] Get right perplexity.
[Keep Moving 35] [5, July, 2018] Configure Chinese Corpus. Accomplish Chinese character inference. The Cacluation of likelihood and perplexity still need debug.
[Keep Moving 36] [6, July, 2018] Update the developmenet memo.
[Keep Moving 37] [10, July, 2018] Implement the cache model, need to test and refine.
[Keep Moving 38] [11, July, 2018] Test the cache model successfully, the module of token completion ran free of bugs.
[Keep Moving 39] [12, July, 2018] Add search unit, and implement BFContextSearcher UNFINISHED.
